# ArtGridz: Introducing Imprint-NFTs & a free-to-play pixel art experience

The Lightest Pixel Art App on the Internet:
No servers, no middlemen—just pure blockchain technology. Our app visualizes and records every change through blockchain events, ensuring total transparency and security.

With our intuitive components, you can easily color pixels, collaborate with the community in real-time, and watch live changes unfold. Plus, monetize your creations by turning them into Imprint-NFTs on ArtGridz or CustomGridz, and showcase them on the marketplace for others to enjoy and collect.
